      You and Cinko.com agree that any and all Claims or disputes arising from
      your use of Cinko will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in
      court, except that you and we may assert Claims on an individual basis in
      small claims court if they qualify. This includes any Claims you assert
      against us, our hotel affiliates, travel suppliers or any companies
      offering products or services through us (which hereby are also
      beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any
      Claims that arose before you accepted this Agreement regardless of whether
      prior versions of the Agreement required arbitration.
    </p>
    <p class="faq-section__text mb-5">
      You hereby agree that there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court
      review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can
      award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court
      (including statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs). The arbitrator
      must follow and enforce this Agreement.

      strictly and only be conducted on an INDIVIDUAL basis and under no
      circumstances whatsoever in a class action, consolidated, or
      representative action. The arbitrator will have authority to decide issues
      as to the scope of thisarbitration agreement and the arbitrability of
      Claims. If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in
      arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.
    </p>
    <p class="faq-section__text mb-5">
      To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting
      arbitration and describing your Claims to Cinko Legal Department, 1500

      against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street
      address you have provided. The AAA's rules and filing instructions are
      available at www.adr.org or by calling

        You acknowledge that Cinko.com pre-negotiates the room rates with our
        affiliate hotels however, upon your arrival to the affiliate hotel
        property, the hotel may ask you for payment for taxes and other fees as
        well as may request that you allow a room deposit on your credit or debit
        card for incidental expenses. The room rate displayed on the affiliate
        hotel website is completely independent of the room rate on Cinko. You
        authorize Cinko.com to book reservations only for the reservation price,
        which only includes the Cinko room rate displayed but DOES NOT include tax
        recovery charges, service fees, and where applicable, taxes on Cinko’s
        services and/or other hotel fees such as occupancy and other fees. You
        agree that your credit card will be charged by Cinko.com for the total
        room reservation price; however, upon arrival to your hotel, the hotel, at
        its sole discretion, may add other fees to your reservation. Upon

        property reservations on your behalf, including making payment
        arrangements with property suppliers.

        taxes on behalf of the hotel affiliates for remittance to applicable
        taxing authorities. The property suppliers charge you for the taxes and/or
        occupancy and other fees at the time of your checking in to the hotel. The
        property suppliers are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the
        applicable taxing jurisdictions. Cinko has absolutely no responsibility to
        remit any taxes and/or other fees to the taxing authorities other than

        travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly
        by location and these are solely transactions and responsibilities between
        you, the traveler and the hotel. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate
